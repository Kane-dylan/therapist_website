                Finding time and opportunities to care for ourselves can be
                incredibly challenging in today's busy and demanding world. I
                believe therapy offers a dedicated space for self-care,
                providing the support and tools needed to improve this essential
                practice. Therapy can help individuals identify and clarify
                their goals, values, and the various elements that contribute to
                their well-being, recognizing that these aspects vary from
                person to person.

              <p className="mb-5">
                I am dedicated to supporting this journey by offering active
                listening, psychological knowledge, empathy, compassion, and
                insights into behavioral patterns and tendencies. I hold a
                masterâ€™s degree in Clinical Psychology from the Michigan School
                of Psychology (2012) and a Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from
                Western Michigan University (2018). My experience spans therapy
                and psychological assessment in psychiatric inpatient units,
                academic medical centers, universities, and outpatient practice
                settings.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-5">
                My therapeutic approach is primarily psychodynamic and
                humanistic, enriched by influences from positive psychology,
                existentialism, family systems theory, acceptance and commitment
                concepts, and mindfulness practices.
