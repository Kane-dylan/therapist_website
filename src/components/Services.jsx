            Whatever the source of your stress, you don't have to face it alone.

                The care you provide for others may be driving you to seek
                therapy, whether due to burnout, compassion fatigue, imposter
                syndrome, people-pleasing tendencies, or perfectionism. Whether
                you're in pre-professional school, undergoing training, or
                reflecting on a long career in healthcare, we can address the
                unique stressors of your professional environment along with any
                challenges you may be facing in other areas of your life.

                deeply meaningful, can lead to profound experiences of trauma
                and grief. Therapy offers a supportive space to process these
                experiences, care for yourself amidst painful thoughts and
                emotions, and work toward a sense of grounding and meaning.

                Second-generation individuals in immigrant families, born in the
                U.S. to at least one parent born abroad, often navigate the
                complexities of multiple cultures and diverse expectations. This
                experience can bring challenges such as feeling like a foreigner
                in your own country and navigating strained family
                relationships. Therapy offers a supportive space to explore and
                process this unique aspect of your identity.
